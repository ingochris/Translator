Web Speech API Example
======================
To give this a go, you need Chrome 25+ installed, which probably means you need to install Google Chrome beta, which is available at:

<https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/beta.html>

Open <http://khoomeister.github.com/web-speech-api-example/> to give it a go.

There is also an input box with the `x-webkit-speech` attribute for comparison.
